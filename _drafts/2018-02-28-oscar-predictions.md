**BEST PICTURE**

[*Call Me by Your Name*]()
*Darkest Hour*
[*Dunkirk*]()
*Get Out*
*Lady Bird*
*Phantom Thread*
[*The Post*]()
[*The Shape of Water*]({% post_url 2018/2018-02/2018-02-19-00579-the-shape-of-water %})
[*Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri*]({% post_url 2018/2018-02/2018-02-26-00582-three-billboards %})

Most Deserving: *Arrival*

Most Likely: *La La Land*

Why:

**BEST DIRECTOR**

Denis Villeneuve, *Arrival*
Mel Gibson, *Hacksaw Ridge*
Damien Chazelle, *La La Land*
Kenneth Lonergan, *Manchester by the Sea*
Barry Jenkins, *Moonlight*

Most Deserving: Barry Jenkins

Most Likely: Damien Chazelle

**BEST ACTOR**
Casey Affleck, *Manchester by the Sea*
Andrew Garfield, *Hacksaw Ridge*
Ryan Gosling, *La La Land*
Viggo Mortensen, *Captain Fantastic*
Denzel Washington, *Fences*

Most Deserving: Andrew Garfield

Most Likely: Denzel Washington

Why: I’m really upset I didn’t get a chance to see *Fences* before the Oscars this year, mainly because it should be a lock for both of it’s acting nominations. Not having seen it, my most deserving choice has to be Andrew Garfield instead. Casey Affleck is the obvious other contender in this race and it should be a tossup between him and Denzel. While I was a fan of Affleck’s performance and of *Manchester by the Sea* as a whole, I don’t think it was a performance that locked in a win, so I’m deferring to a few others opinion on Washington’s performance.

**BEST ACTRESS**

Isabelle Huppert, *Elle*
Ruth Negga, *Loving*
Natalie Portman, [*Jackie*](http://www.reelmatt.com/post/156733407458/jackie)
Emma Stone, *La La Land*
Meryl Streep, *Florence Foster Jenkins*

Most Deserving: Emma Stone

Most Likely: Emma Stone

**BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR**

Mahershala Ali, *Moonlight*
Jeff Bridges, *Hell or High Water*
Lucas Hedges, *Manchester by the Sea*
Dev Patel, *Lion*
Michael Shannon, *Nocturnal Animals*

Most Deserving: Jeff Bridges

Most Likely: Mahershala Ali

Why: *Moonlight* was an excellent film overall, including many wonderful performances. Mahershala Ali is one of the obvious standouts in the film, but he only appears for what seems like a small part of the film, and I don’t think his performance is good enough for the time he appears to get the award. He does seem to be the frontrunner, so he’s my pick for Most Likely. Jeff Bridges is my personal choice mainly because I want to give *Hell or High Water* some love and the only other nominee I saw was Lucas Hedges who was merely alright.

**BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS**

Viola Davis, *Fences*
Naomie Harris, *Moonlight*
Nicole Kidman, *Lion*
Octavia Spencer, *Hidden Figures*
Michelle Williams, *Manchester by the Sea*

Most Deserving: Octavia Spencer

Most Likely: Viola Davis

Why: Again, I’m sad I didn’t get to see *Fences* and many seem to agree Davis is a lock for this award. Michelle Williams is the consensus for the runner-up, which I disagree with, again for similar reasons to Mahershala Ali in *Moonlight* — she only appears in a small portion of the film. Therefore, my personal choice is Octavia Spencer.

**BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY**

*20th Century Women* by Mike Mills
*Hell or High Water* by Taylor Sheridan
*La La Land* by Damien Chazelle
*The Lobster* by Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthimis Filippou
*Manchester by the Sea* by Kenneth Lonergan

Most Deserving: *The Lobster*

Most Likely: *Manchester by the Sea*

**BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY**

*Arrival* by Eric Heisserer
*Fences* by August Wilson
*Hidden Figures* by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi
*Lion* by Luke Davies
*Moonlight* by Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney

Most Deserving: *Arrival*

Most Likely: *Moonlight*

**BEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM**

*Kubo and the Two Strings*
*Moana*
*My Life as a Zucchini*
*The Red Turtle*
*Zootopia*

Most Deserving: *Moana*

Most Likely: *Zootopia*

**BEST FOREIGN FILM**

*Land of Mine* (Denmark)
*A Man Called Ove* (Sweden)
*The Salesman* (Iran)
*Tanna* (Australia)
*Toni Erdmann* (Germany)

Most Deserving: N/A

Most Likely: *The Salesman*

**BEST DOCUMENTARY**

*Fire at Sea
I Am Not Your Negro
Life, Animated
O.J.: Made in America
13th*

Most Deserving: *O.J.: Made in America*

Most Likely: *O.J.: Made in America*

Why: I just finished watching the O.J. documentary (it’s quite a doozy and packs a wallop of a runtime) and it’s the only one I’ve seen this year. It was a great accompaniment to FX’s dramatized version *The People vs. O.J. Simpson* (also great). In short: I’ve got a review on both coming, and count on it taking home some gold.

**BEST DOCUMENTARY (SHORT)**

“Extremis"
"4.1 Miles"
"Joe’s Violin"
"Watani: My Homeland"
"The White Helmets”

Most Deserving: N/A

Most Likely: “The White Helmets"

**BEST COSTUME DESIGN**

*Allied
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
Florence Foster Jenkins
Jackie
La La Land*

Most Deserving: *Jackie*

Most Likely: *La La Land*

**BEST ORIGINAL SONG**

“Audition (The Fools Who Dream)” from *La La Land*
“Can’t Stop the Feeling!” from *Trolls*
“City of Stars” from *La La Land*
“The Empty Chair” from *Jim: The James Foley Story*
“How Far I’ll Go” from [*Moana*](http://www.reelmatt.com/post/133567124148/spectre)

Most Deserving: “How Far I’ll Go"

Most Likely: “City of Stars"

**BEST ORIGINAL SCORE**

*Jackie
La La Land
Lion
Moonlight
Passengers*

Most Deserving: *La La Land*

Most Likely: *La La Land*

**BEST MAKEUP AND HAIRSTYLING**

*A Man Called Ove
Star Trek Beyond
Suicide Squad*

Most Deserving: *Star Trek Beyond*

Most Likely: *Star Trek Beyond*

**BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN**

*Arrival
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
Hail, Caesar!
La La Land
Passengers*

Most Deserving: *Arrival*

Most Likely: *La La Land*

**BEST FILM EDITING**

*Arrival
Hacksaw Ridge
Hell or High Water
La La Land
Moonlight*

Most Deserving: *Arrival*

Most Likely: *La La Land*

Why: Just see above in my Best Picture explanation. *Hacksaw Ridge* would probably take last place here for me with *La La Land* coming in at fourth place. Any of the remaining three in my opinion are more deserving of the win in this category and will be genuinely excited if that happens — ideally with an *Arrival* win. But alas, *La La Land* will probably take this on it’s way to a near or full clean sweep.

Lion

Silence*

Most Deserving: *Arrival*

Most Likely: *La La Land*

**BEST SOUND EDITING**

Most Likely: *Hacksaw Ridge*

**BEST VISUAL EFFECTS**
