## BEST ORIGINAL SCORE

Film |Composer
-----|--------
*Dunkirk* | Hans Zimmer
*Phantom Thread* | Jonny Greenwood
*The Shape of Water* | Alexandre Desplat
[*Star Wars: The Last Jedi*]({% post_url 2017/2017-12/2017-12-15-star-wars-the-last-jedi.md %}) | John Williams
*Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri* | Carter Burwell

Most Deserving: *Dunkirk*

Most Likely: *The Shape of Water*

Why: Far and away my favorite aspect of *Dunkirk* was its score. It is memorable, propulsive, and core piece of the film's identity. I even have several tracks saved on my Spotify — great for work to get one of the songs to turn up on shuffle. Hans Zimmer's music does always sound of the same ilk, but his past several scores have always stood out to me for different reasons and *Interstellar* was my choice for the 87th Academy Awards. In an odd coincidence, just like in 2015, it appears that Alexandre Desplat will once again walk away with the Oscar for his work on *The Shape of Water*.

## BEST FILM EDITING

Film |
-----|
*Baby Driver*|
*Dunkirk*|
*I, Tonya*|
*The Shape of Water*|
*Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri*|

Most Deserving: *Dunkirk*

Most Likely: *Baby Driver*

Why: The consensus seems to be split between *Baby Driver* and *Dunkirk*. *Dunkirk* was the favorite by count of the sites I track when making these predictions, and war films often win this category. *Baby Driver* is my pick for its recent win at the BAFTAs, even though it may be a slight underdog odds-wise. There are a lot of films I wish I'd seen this year, and *Baby Driver* is probably at the top of that list. Trailer editing is completely separate from film editing, but based on [the trailer alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTvJJnoWIPk) I'm going to give this the win. *Dunkirk* was phenomenal and is the most deserving of the films I saw, but even so, there were a few story-related problems that I would say are a cause of editing — everything doesn't need to always be a time-altered mess of the mind Christopher Nolan.
