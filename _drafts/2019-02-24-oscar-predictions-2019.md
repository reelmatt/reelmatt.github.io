This is now the sixth year I'm making predictions for the Academy Awards, and unlike years past I'm getting these out more than just a few hours before the ceremony starts! 2018 was an off year for me in terms of getting to the theater and see a lot of the nominees. My goal every year is to see **all** the Best Picture nominees, a feat I was able to accomplish three times (for the 85th, 87th, and 88th Academy Awards — and only one or two away the other years). Unfortunately, I only saw four of the nine nominees this year (I'm hoping to get to the theater this weekend to see one or two more, and will update this post if I do, but my predictions are locked).

Of all the years to not see most of the nominees, I chose a year when there were a lot of good films to choose from. As I'll mention in a few of my explanations below about why I chose my "Most Deserving" and "Most Likely" picks, I'm really disappointed in myself for not having seen more. I've only heard outstanding things about *Get Out*, *Coco*, and *Baby Driver* (my semi-dark horse pick for Best Film Editing) among others. *Lady Bird* was less universally praised but still phenomenal and deserving of its nominations from what I've heard.

Every year around Oscar time I always get back into the swing of things, watching and reviewing a lot of movies. It is my way of prepping for the Oscars and always like a reset button for me. It wasn't until I saw *Three Billboards* and *The Post* last weekend did I realize that woah, the Oscars are in a week! They really snuck up on me this year which is why I'm scrambling a bit. I make a promise every year to use this as an opportunity to really re-commit myself to this blog and these reviews, and hopefully I keep that commitment more than I have in years past. It'll never get to the level I was in Year 1 where I met my goal of watching 365 films in 365 days, but hopefully it is more than the meager 15 films I reviewed in 2017.

## BEST ORIGINAL SCORE

Film                         |Composer
-----------------------------|--------
*Black Panther*              | Ludwig Göransson
*BlacKkKlansman*             | Terence Blanchard
*If Beale Street Could Talk* | Nicholas Britell
*Isle of Dogs*               | Alexandre Desplat
*Mary Poppins Returns*       | Marc Shaiman

Most Deserving: *First Man*, Justin Hurwitz

Most Likely: *The Shape of Water*

Why: Far and away my favorite aspect of *Dunkirk* was its score. It is memorable, propulsive, and core piece of the film's identity. I even have several tracks saved on my Spotify — great for work to get one of the songs to turn up on shuffle. Hans Zimmer's music does always sound of the same ilk, but his past several scores have always stood out to me for different reasons and *Interstellar* was my choice for the 87th Academy Awards. In an odd coincidence, just like in 2015, it appears that Alexandre Desplat will once again walk away with the Oscar for his work on *The Shape of Water*.

## BEST FILM EDITING

Film |
-----|
*BlacKkKlansman*|
*Bohemian Rhapsody*|
*The Favourite*|
*Green Book*|
*Vice*|

Most Deserving: **

Most Likely: **

Why: The consensus seems to be split between *Baby Driver* and *Dunkirk*. *Dunkirk* was the favorite by count of the sites I track when making these predictions, and war films often win this category. *Baby Driver* is my pick for its recent win at the BAFTAs, even though it may be a slight underdog odds-wise. There are a lot of films I wish I'd seen this year, and *Baby Driver* is probably at the top of that list. Trailer editing is completely separate from film editing, but based on [the trailer alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTvJJnoWIPk) I'm going to give this the win. *Dunkirk* was phenomenal and is the most deserving of the films I saw, but even so, there were a few story-related problems that I would say are a cause of editing — everything doesn't need to always be a time-altered mess of the mind Christopher Nolan.
