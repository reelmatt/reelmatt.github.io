#### THE REVIEW
I'll keep this review short and start by saying, *Going in Style* delivers everything that you would expect to get from a film like this. If seeing a group of three old men trying to pull off a bank heist does not sound appealing to you, don't even bother. However, if you are someone like me, who loves a good heist film, and finds three old men trying to do it funny, then you're not going to go wrong with *Going in Style*. Look no further than my review for [*Last Vegas*][1], a film also starring Morgan Freeman with a premise of "old people doing ___ that is normally a young person action film". The camaraderie between Freeman, Michael Caine, and Alan Arkin (who delivers some of the funniest moments in the film) is spot-on, the whole set up for the bank robbery is as perfectly planned as you would want for this quality of film, and the old-people humor is funny for people of all ages. There really isn't much more for me to say about *Going in Style*. Watch the trailer. If you find it funny or entertaining, you'll most likely enjoy the film. Otherwise, give it a pass. You'll know if this film is for you or not. Luckily for me, it was an hour and a half of good laughs and jaunty fun.
