#### THE REVIEW
It's the weekend, my classes are finished for the semester, and I'm bored looking for something to do. So that means time to watch a whole bunch of movies and television and since I currently have HBO for *Westworld*, I'll make my way through the movie selection they have.

*She's Out of My League* is great for what it is: a relaxing rom-com to fill some time. That description seems a bit condescending (it's not *just* a filler movie), but it works in a pinch. I laughed, I wasn't bored, character and story development were decent for a 100-minute flick; there's not much more I could've asked for. It doesn't reach the level of some romantic-comedies I've seen recently like [*What If*][1] but it doesn't need to to be enjoyable.

Jay Baruchel does a stand up job as Kirk Kettner, and while Alice Eve as the "perfect-10" Molly McCleish plays well opposite him, it's Krysten Ritter (best known to me as Jessica Jones from the Netflix show) as Patty delivers an even better performance. All-in-all, *She's Out of My League* was a solid middle-of-the-road, nothing amazing but nothing horrible, three-star film.

#### THE RATING
3 out of 5
