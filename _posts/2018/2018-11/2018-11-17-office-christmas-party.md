#### THE REVIEW
*Office Christmas Party* is a real trash film. The story and characters are real thin, there is not a lot going on and not much thought process needed to get through the main plot - a failing office "needs" to throw a party, mainly because Clay Vanstone (T.J. Miller) wants to. It is full of debauchery, crude jokes, physical humor, and one-liners. Based on this description alone, or just watching the trailer, you should know if *Office Christmas Party* is the kind of film for you. While I would agree it is not really a great film, I did find myself laughing more than I expected to and was satisfied with the hole this movie filled on a random evening-viewing. To me, that seems the perfect opportunity for this film - a random night in November or December, you have nothing else to do, and might want a few easy, cheap laughs. Then again, it might also not be your kind of humor, so watch 30 seconds of the trailer first to see if it will be a fit for you.

3 out of 5
