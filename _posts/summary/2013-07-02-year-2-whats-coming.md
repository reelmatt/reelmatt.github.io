At this point you may be asking, “Year 1 is over, now what?” Well, as you may have already read, this past year has been quite an experience, one which I hope to recreate. Not only was it beneficial in a broad sense, but it also accomplished my main goal which I set out in my first post for the marathon:

The goal of this Movie Marathon is to catch up on a whole bunch of movies I haven’t seen.

And in terms of that, I was very successful. Of course, a few repeats made their way into the marathon, but the great majority of films were ones I never saw before, many of them big classics like The Wizard of Oz or Casablanca. So it’s with this idea in mind that I set forth my goals and plans for this second year of my movie marathon.
The goal remains the same: to watch a bunch of movies on my ever-growing “To Watch” list (currently at 530 films) and attempt to articulate my thoughts in a review. Here’s what’s different: no more one film per day. While it was quite a challenge, after a year of mostly adhering to that mission (with double- and even triple-features to make up for lost time), I think it’s safe to say I’ve had enough. It really isn’t feasible to do this especially when there are other priorities like school work or holidays that come along. My new mission will (hopefully) alleviate all that stress.
Over the course of this next year, from today until July 1, 2014, my goal is to watch a minimum of 135 films. Why 135? Well, first that would get me to a nice even 500 films total and second, I don’t want to bite off more than I can chew again. Remember I said “minimum of”. Chances are, I’ll watch more than 135 films, but I’d rather be able to meet my goal and then surpass it rather than struggle to make up for missed days. This new plan roughly equates to 3 films per week, but that’s just an average - some will have less, some more.
Continue to be on the lookout for all the advanced screenings I go to and the special chains (read: themes) I create for the marathon. And of course still be on the lookout for what I hope will be another great batch of films. Time permitting, I may also be introducing new types of posts including my thoughts on TV shows, movie trailers, and much, much more. I’m not promising anything now, but given the lighter load, I’m sure I’ll be able to get a more diverse set of content out
Thank you for reading and for your support over this past year. I hope you stick around for this next year, and for many years to come.
