#### THE REVIEW
An okay sequel to a [good original film][1], *Ant-Man and the Wasp* brings more of the same comedy and hijinks that the first one did. The simplest take is: if you liked the first *Ant-Man*, you'll like this one.

The Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Douglas trio continues to have a great chemistry together, even with added drama in this film. I feel like the minor characters had more of a time to shine here, mostly to great success. Seeing more of Michael Pena's character especially was a treat.

And I'll leave it at that; short and sweet. I'll spare you from rehashing my standard pros and cons about characters, pacing, and whatnot or spoilers discussing the quantum realm &mdash; the biggest differentiator with *Ant-Man and the Wasp*. You'll either be familiar enough with these movies to know if this is for you (it's an average Marvel film), or you'll have seen no superhero movies, in which case: A) what are you doing, and B) start with something else.

#### THE RATING
3 out of 5
