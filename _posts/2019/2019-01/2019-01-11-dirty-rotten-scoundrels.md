#### THE REVIEW
*Dirty Rotten Scoundrels* is a good, old-timey (circa 1988) film that ended up surprising me a bit. Back in my marathon heyday, I tended to watch a fair amount of older films, mostly classics that I never got around to watching. A common refrain for me is that the older the film, the slower it is &mdash;, that is just the nature of films of the era. Nothing inherently wrong about it, but given the faster-pace of more modern films it can often be a tough pill to swallow.

Watching the trailer for *Dirty Rotten Scoundrels*, I was skeptical. It seems to tick all of those "slow" and "boring" boxes without enough of a hook to keep me interested. Regardless, I ended up watching it anyway, and happily, I found myself laughing along, not paying attention to the pacing of the film. Freddy Benson (Steve Martin) and Lawrence Jamieson (Michael Caine) are terrific characters with a wonderful chemistry together.

Pacing can be an important part to a great film, but it is not the defining characteristic of a great film. Pacing can mask defects, and otherwise gloss over moments that, if you had a second to think about, would probably realize are silly and detract from the story. In this sense, older films are playing a game on difficult mode; needing to grab you by the basics and fundamentals of good story telling. I think that is why, when you come across a good, "classic" movie, it can be ten times better than a great movie today. *Dirty Rotten Scoundrels* is not in the crème de la crème, but it is a solid comedy. A simple premise &mdash; con men making a bet on who can cheat $50,000 out of Janet Colgate (Glenne Headly) first &mdash; that you easily get swept up in due to the charisma of Martin and Caine, the antics that ensue, and just an overall well-scripted story with a few twists and turns to keep things interesting.

Highly suggest checking this out. Whether you have seen it before and give it a re-watch, or discovering it for the first time, *Dirty Rotten Scoundrels* is sure to deliver some laughs and a good time.
