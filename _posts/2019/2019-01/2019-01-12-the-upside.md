#### THE REVIEW
This was the first film I saw as part of my new AMC A-List subscription (more on that in a future post after I have spent some time with it), and *The Upside* is pretty much what I was expecting. It is a run-of-the-mill dramedy (more parts comedy) featuring big-name stars Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston. It checked off a lot of common based-on-a-true-story cliches, had well-defined but mostly foreseeable character arcs, and slightly contrived moments of emotion.

A quick skim of other critics' reviews seem to all come to a similar consensus, but trending more negative. The [Rotten Tomatoes summary][1] says the film is "frustratingly cliched" and [Mark Kennedy of the *Associated Press*][2] said "few films in memory have squandered so much acting talent in such a cliche-ridden... way".

My take? Yeah, it has its problems. *The Upside* is not winning any awards or trying anything remotely new or original. It is full of cliches but I do not find it "frustrating" or that it "squanders" the talents of Hart and Cranston. Sure, it does not really soar in a way it possibly could have, but *The Upside* is still a decent film, a good, average, film that is easy to turn on and watch when you cannot really decide something. Not worth a viewing in the theater &mdash; unless it is "free" with something like A-List &mdash; but do not shy away when it hits streaming services.
