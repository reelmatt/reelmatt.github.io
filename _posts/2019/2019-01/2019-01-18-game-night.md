#### THE REVIEW
When I saw the trailer for *Game Night* I laughed a good amount and immediately put it on my watch list, but then fast-forward a year and I hadn't gotten around to seeing it. Many friends hyped up the movie and I heard almost exclusively great things, so onto the Christmas list it went, and I've finally gotten around to seeing *Game Night*.

Sure enough, *Game Night* delivers what is on the tin. It is a start-to-finish good time, full of laughs, a fair share of twists and turns, a bit of drama, and some good A- and B-list stars acting well together. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams are the clear stars of the show, Lamorne Morris is also great (although shockingly similar to his *New Girl* character), and Kyle Chandler is fantastic as always.

There really isn't much more to say about this film. It is a film great for putting on when you don't know what to watch to kill some time, but *also* good when you have a hankering for some comedy, or even some action. *Game Night* has a bunch of different ins to like about the movie, and it is almost a slam dunk on all of them.
