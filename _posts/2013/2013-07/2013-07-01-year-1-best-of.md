As the year progressed and the number of films steadily increased, I began making lists of all the top films I watched along the way. In each of the four lists, I compiled the best of the best along with summaries of each of my reviews and a section awarding top honors to just four of the films (one for Best Comedy, Best Drama, Best Classic, and Best New Release). Now that the year is over, and the list of just the best films is quite extensive, I wanted to create a single repository for them.
Below you’ll find the entire list of all the films to which I awarded five-stars with links to the individual reviews. There’s also a similar, but expanded, list of awards in addition to a few honorable mentions. Some of the categories are self-explanatory, but a few I’ll clarify here. Best Blockbuster covers any big-budget, “tentpole” film whereas Best Indie covers smaller films, though not necessarily an independent release per se. Best Underdog is awarded to the most unexpectedly great film, not necessarily an underdog story. And of course, honorable mentions are the three films that I wanted to give awards to but another stood in their way.
So enjoy this trip down memory lane, and maybe you’ll find the next film you want to watch.
