This is my fifth year doing Oscar predictions since I started this site, and every subsequent year seems to get harder and harder. Partially because of the nominees but also because I’ve been procrastinating more and more as the years go by. Earlier today I posted two final reviews of Best Picture nominees and am writing this preface to my predictions on a train back from Salem. There’s also several major nominees I didn’t get around to watching including Fences (Best Picture and Denzel Washington for Best Actor) and Lion (Picture and Adapted Screenplay).

But I also write this during a bit of a resurgence for me. After barely watching or reviewing films last year, I tried my best to get back in the habit and have been partially successful (I’m satisfied with the frequency I’ve achieved after it being near zero). Hopefully I can continue this practice the rest of the year so I can share my thoughts with the (admittedly few) who care enough to read my thoughts. And for those who don’t, I did start logging my films on Letterboxd so you can follow my goings on there, if that’s more amenable to you.



I usually take this time to give a recap of how I’ve done in previous years, but I’m running up against my publishing deadline, so I’m simply just going to include links for now to my 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 predictions where you can see for yourself. I’m hoping this year can be more like 2014 where I got 92% correct. This year seems a bit more straightforward with some contentious races, but the others not so much (read: expect a *La La Land* near clean sweep, ugh). Last disclosure, whereas most years I spend weeks researching what the critics and prognosticators think about who will win the trophies, this year that time is only a few hours (because again, I really procrastinated this year). But see below for my personal pick for Most Deserving and who I think is Most Likely. 

BEST PICTURE

Arrival

Fences

Hacksaw Ridge

Hell or High Water

Hidden Figures

La La Land

Lion

Manchester by the Sea

Moonlight

Most Deserving: ArrivalMost Likely: La La Land

Why: I’ll take this  as my space to say just how much I dislike La La Land. The film was enjoyable enough, getting three stars out of five from me and it is certainly deserving of a few nominations at the least. At 14 nominations in 13 categories (it has two for Best Original Song) it is expected to get close to, or even nail a full clean sweep. Much like when Silver Linings Playbook took the Oscars by force in 2013, I was vehemently against it winning any because I thought it’s praise was vastly overblown. So in a sense, my adverse reaction to La La Land winning any awards tonight is not entirely rational, yet nonetheless is how I feel.

Arrival on the other hand was one of my favorite films of the year, if not my absolute favorite. Because of this, Arrival got the most picks for me in my Most Deserving category, aka my personal favorite. While I will gladly take any and all wins by Arrival, I’m going with general consensus for most awards that La La Land will get lots and lots.

BEST DIRECTOR

Denis Villeneuve, Arrival

Mel Gibson, Hacksaw Ridge

Damien Chazelle, La La Land

Kenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea

Barry Jenkins, Moonlight

Most Deserving: Barry JenkinsMost Likely: Damien Chazelle

BEST ACTOR 

Casey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea

Andrew Garfield, Hacksaw Ridge

Ryan Gosling, La La Land

Viggo Mortensen, Captain Fantastic

Denzel Washington, Fences

Most Deserving: Andrew GarfieldMost Likely: Denzel Washington

Why: I’m really upset I didn’t get a chance to see Fences before the Oscars this year, mainly because it should be a lock for both of it’s acting nominations. Not having seen it, my most deserving choice has to be Andrew Garfield instead. Casey Affleck is the obvious other contender in this race and it should be a tossup between him and Denzel. While I was a fan of Affleck’s performance and of Manchester by the Sea as a whole, I don’t think it was a performance that locked in a win, so I’m deferring to a few others’ opinion on Washington’s performance.

BEST ACTRESS

Isabelle Huppert, Elle

Ruth Negga, Loving

Natalie Portman, Jackie

Emma Stone, La La Land

Meryl Streep, Florence Foster Jenkins

Most Deserving: Emma StoneMost Likely: Emma Stone

BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR

Mahershala Ali, Moonlight

Jeff Bridges, Hell or High Water

Lucas Hedges, Manchester by the Sea

Dev Patel, Lion

Michael Shannon, Nocturnal Animals

Most Deserving: Jeff BridgesMost Likely: Mahershala Ali

Why: Moonlight was an excellent film overall, including many wonderful performances. Mahershala Ali is one of the obvious standouts in the film, but he only appears for what seems like a small part of the film, and I don’t think his performance is good enough for the time he appears to get the award. He does seem to be the frontrunner, so he’s my pick for Most Likely. Jeff Bridges is my personal choice mainly because I want to give Hell or High Water some love and the only other nominee I saw was Lucas Hedges who was merely alright.

BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS

Viola Davis, Fences

Naomie Harris, Moonlight

Nicole Kidman, Lion

Octavia Spencer, Hidden Figures

Michelle Williams, Manchester by the Sea

Most Deserving: Octavia SpencerMost Likely: Viola Davis

Why: Again, I’m sad I didn’t get to see Fences and many seem to agree Davis is a lock for this award. Michelle Williams is the consensus for the runner-up, which I disagree with, again for similar reasons to Mahershala Ali in Moonlight — she only appears in a small portion of the film. Therefore, my personal choice is Octavia Spencer.

BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY

20th Century Women by Mike Mills

Hell or High Water by Taylor Sheridan

La La Land by Damien Chazelle

The Lobster by Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthimis Filippou

Manchester by the Sea by Kenneth Lonergan

Most Deserving: The LobsterMost Likely: Manchester by the Sea

BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY

Arrival by Eric Heisserer

Fences by August Wilson

Hidden Figures by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi

Lion by Luke Davies

Moonlight by Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney

Most Deserving: ArrivalMost Likely: Moonlight

BEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM

Kubo and the Two Strings

Moana

My Life as a Zucchini

The Red Turtle

Zootopia

Most Deserving: MoanaMost Likely: Zootopia

BEST FOREIGN FILM

Land of Mine (Denmark)

A Man Called Ove (Sweden)

The Salesman (Iran)

Tanna (Australia)

Toni Erdmann (Germany)

Most Deserving: N/AMost Likely: The Salesman

BEST DOCUMENTARY

Fire at Sea

I Am Not Your Negro

Life, Animated

O.J.: Made in America

13th

Most Deserving: O.J.: Made in AmericaMost Likely: O.J.: Made in America

Why: I just finished watching the O.J. documentary (it’s quite a doozy and packs a wallop of a runtime) and it’s the only one I’ve seen this year. It was a great accompaniment to FX’s dramatized version The People vs. O.J. Simpson (also great). In short: I’ve got a review on both coming, and count on it taking home some gold.

BEST DOCUMENTARY (SHORT)

“Extremis"

“4.1 Miles”

“Joe’s Violin”

“Watani: My Homeland”

“The White Helmets”

Most Deserving: N/AMost Likely: “The White Helmets”

BEST COSTUME DESIGN

Allied

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them

Florence Foster Jenkins

Jackie

La La Land

Most Deserving: JackieMost Likely: La La Land

BEST ORIGINAL SONG

“Audition (The Fools Who Dream)” from La La Land

“Can’t Stop the Feeling!” from Trolls

“City of Stars” from La La Land

“The Empty Chair” from Jim: The James Foley Story

“How Far I’ll Go” from Moana

Most Deserving: “How Far I’ll Go"Most Likely: “City of Stars"

BEST ORIGINAL SCORE

Jackie

La La Land

Lion

Moonlight

Passengers

Most Deserving: La La LandMost Likely: La La Land

BEST MAKEUP AND HAIRSTYLING

A Man Called Ove

Star Trek Beyond

Suicide Squad

Most Deserving: Star Trek BeyondMost Likely: Star Trek Beyond

BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN

Arrival

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them

Hail, Caesar!

La La Land

Passengers

Most Deserving: ArrivalMost Likely: La La Land

BEST FILM EDITING

Arrival

Hacksaw Ridge

Hell or High Water

La La Land

Moonlight

Most Deserving: ArrivalMost Likely: La La Land

Why: Just see above in my Best Picture explanation. Hacksaw Ridge would probably take last place here for me with La La Land coming in at fourth place. Any of the remaining three in my opinion are more deserving of the win in this category and will be genuinely excited if that happens — ideally with an Arrival win. But alas, La La Land will probably take this on it’s way to a near or full clean sweep.
