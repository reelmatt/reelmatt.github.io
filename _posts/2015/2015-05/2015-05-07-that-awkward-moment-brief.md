THE REVIEW: As far as romantic- and buddy-comedies go, That Awkward Moment isn’t all that special. It has extremely funny moments that had me laughing out loud, and a cast with great chemistry, but most of the film played like every other story and cliché in the books. If it weren’t for Miles Teller, Zac Efron, and Michael B. Jordan, That Awkward Moment would most likely fall flat and none of the jokes would strike home. With these three actors though, they can at least carry the film long enough to keep you entertained for 90 minutes.

It is your standard boy meets girl, they fall in love, something breaks them apart, they get back together cycle in romantic comedies. You could consider it fresh in that you follow three young adults in New York City — a situation that I at least have not encountered in another film — but it’s really just a matter of setting and number of characters. Countless other films have portrayed the womanizing men, lusting after a one-night stand and a “roster” of women with which to choose from. None really come to mind which can either speak to my lack of familiarity with the romantic-comedy genre, or, that those films as a whole are forgettable. Regardless, That Awkward Moment joins the ranks, and I would say even surpasses the level to which women are objectified (it really is ridiculous and disgusting; what is so hard about committing to one person at a time?). My guess is that a few months from now, my only memories from this film will be the ones I’m currently writing down in this review.

That being said, for the 94 minute runtime of That Awkward Moment, I was thoroughly entertained. It can easily be classified as a fun film to watch when you have nothing else to do. There are plenty worse ways to spend your time than watching a decently funny film. I realize these adjectives don’t necessarily give this film the ringing endorsement I’m trying to give it, but as with the film, it can go both ways. Don’t look to That Awkward Moment as an Oscar-worthy, 5-star film you can watch over and over again. That Awkward Moment is that neutral film which you will neither be overly upset or thrilled you saw.

THE RATING: 3 out of 5
