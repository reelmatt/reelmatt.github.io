THE REVIEW: About Time is a movie full of heart, spunk, and a generally uplifting message to live in the moment and appreciate even the small things in life. You might dismiss the film as cheesy for using time travel, or for being yet another romantic comedy where everything works out in the end and all is perfect, but you’d be missing a big draw to About Time.

Perhaps this is my eternal optimism talking, but there’s a simple reason I enjoy watching films like About Time. Put simply: they are fun! Countless times I found myself laughing at combinations of jokes, character traits, and amusing situations that characters were placed in. Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) is born into a family where all the men have the ability to travel back in time. His father (Bill Nighy) warns hims not to use it for money or fame, but isn’t interested in either; he is interested in finding love. As far as time travel goes, it is not as remotely complicated or head-scratching as films like [*Looper*][1] or [*12 Monkeys*][2]. Instead, it’s more along the lines of [*Groundhog Day*][3]: in some ways it is the focus, but really, it’s used more as a tool to further the story and character development, both of which could be done without time travel.

Apparently, the film breaks the time travel rules set up at the beginning of the film and has [several other plot holes][4], and for those trying to dissect this film I’m sure you will find plenty of problems, both technically and creatively. But I urge you not to take that route, as it will most likely be met with disappointment. Instead, take a page out of the film’s own playbook, relax, and enjoy yourself. There’s nothing wrong with feeling happy and optimistic about life and About Time provides you the opportunity to do just that.

THE RATING: 5 out of 5
