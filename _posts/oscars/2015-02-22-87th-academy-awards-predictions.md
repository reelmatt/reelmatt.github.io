It’s that time of year again: awards season! That’s right, over the last month we’ve seen film recognized at the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs, and all the guild awards ranging from the DGA to the WGA. Today, Sunday, February 22 is the culmination of the 2015 awards season with the 87th annual Academy Awards. Once again, as I did for 2013 and 2014, I will be making my predictions as to which nominee is “Most Likely” to win and which I think is the “Most Deserved”.

When I started predicting the Oscars in 2013, I got 17 out of 24 (71%) correct. Last year I did much better getting 22 out of 24 (92%) correct with the only two wrong predictions being those for both Best Short Film awards (Live Action and Animated). Hopefully I can match that success rate this year as my school, Emerson College (of which I’m participating in the Los Angeles program this semester — just over a mile away from the Dolby Theater where the awards are held), is holding a competition with prizes for the people with the most correct guesses.

Check after the jump for who I think will win it what looks to be an extremely close race this year. Birdman and Boyhood are running neck-and-neck for the top prize and The Grand Budapest Hotel seems poised to take home its fair share of technical, and more prestigious, awards.

## BEST PICTURE

Film |
-----|
American Sniper|
Birdman|
Boyhood|
The Grand Budapest Hotel|
The Imitation Game|
Selma|
The Theory of Everything|
Whiplash|

Most Deserving: Boyhood

Most Likely: Birdman

Why: By far my favorite film this year was Boyhood. I couldn’t stop talking about it and saw it in theaters three times because I enjoyed it so much. The film, as you have no doubt heard by now, was filmed over twelve years and tracks the growth of a family over that time. Of all the coming of age stories that have ever been told, Boyhood trumps them all. To see an entire life be condensed down into two and a half hours while still feeling like a complete story is nothing short of amazing. Of the other nominees, I awarded five stars to The Imitation Game, Selma, and Whiplash with the latter probably being my second favorite out of the bunch.

All Oscar prognosticators have deemed this year’s Best Picture race to be among the most competitive and closest in years. Boyhood and Birdman are in a dead heat with the former having won the Golden Globe and the BAFTA but Birdman has swept almost every other race including the PGA, DGA, and SAG awards. It used to be the case that Best Picture and Best Director were linked and one award would be a good predictor of the other. But most believe that this will be the third year in a row with a split decision between Picture and Director. While my heart is for Boyhood, I’m inclined to agree with the general consensus that Birdman will win Best Picture while Richard Linklater will take the trophy for Best Director.

## BEST DIRECTOR

Director              | Film
----------------------|--------------
Alejandro G. Iñárritu | Birdman
Richard Linklater     | Boyhood
Bennett Miller        | Foxcatcher
Wes Anderson          | The Grand Budapest Hotel
Morten Tyldum         | The Imitation Game

Most Deserving: Richard Linklater

Most Likely: Richard Linklater

## BEST ACTOR

Actor                | Film 
---------------------|--------------
Steve Carell         | Foxcatcher
Bradley Cooper       | American Sniper
Benedict Cumberbatch | The Imitation Game
Michael Keaton       | Birdman
Eddie Redmayne       | The Theory of Everything

Most Deserving: Eddie Redmayne

Most Likely: Eddie Redmayne

Why: I’ve been calling for Eddie Redmayne to win this award ever since I saw The Theory of Everything in October and I haven’t wavered on that assertion since. His transformation into Stephen Hawking is nothing short of a monumental achievement and deserves to be recognized. Michael Keaton and Steve Carell both gave wonderful performances and Bradley Cooper was one of the only shining lights I found in American Sniper, though my general dislike for that film has me rooting against Cooper. Still, given the momentum Redmayne has in this category, it’s his to lose.

Marion Cotillard  | Two Days, One Night

Patricia Arquette | Boyhood
Laura Dern        | Wild
Keira Knightley   | The Imitation Game
Emma Stone        | Birdman
Meryl Streep      | Into the Woods

Most Deserving: Patricia Arquette

## BEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM

Film |
-----|
Big Hero 6|
The Boxtrolls|
How to Train Your Dragon 2|
Song of the Sea|
The Tale of Princess Kaguya|

Most Deserving: How to Train Your Dragon 2

Most Likely: How to Train Your Dragon 2

Why: If the voting were up to me (and I’m sure many of the outraged fans who caused an uproar after the nominations were announced), The LEGO Movie would be taking home the Best Animated Feature award this year. Alas, the Academy failed to nominate the film and now the two front runners are Big Hero 6 and How to Train Your Dragon 2. While Big Hero 6 was a decent film, I wouldn’t consider it Oscar-worthy. And besides, How to Train Your Dragon 2 was an outstanding film that blew me away when I saw it way back in June. By all accounts, I thought the sequel was much better than the original How to Train Your Dragon which also won the Best Animated Feature Oscar back in 2006, so in a way it does seem fitting that How to Train Your Dragon 2 will likely be taking home some another gold statue this year.

## BEST ORIGINAL SCORE

Film |
-----|
The Grand Budapest Hotel|
The Imitation Game|
Interstellar|
Mr. Turner|
The Theory of Everything|

Most Deserving: Interstellar

Most Likely: The Grand Budapest Hotel

Why: While my passion for Boyhood to win Best Picture cannot be matched, my love for the Interstellar soundtrack comes in a close second. I am a huge fan of what Hans Zimmer did with the score and it plays such a huge and important role in the entire Interstellar soundscape and overall momentum of the film. Part of the reason Zimmer’s work will probably be overlooked is most people’s frustration with the overall sound of Interstellar complaining it was too loud and you couldn’t understand the dialogue at times. I fell on the opposite side of that camp, arguing in favor of Christopher Nolan’s decision to treat dialogue as just another sound effect that was able to be overshadowed by more “important” elements in particular scenes.

But I digress. For Best Original Score, the race again seems like a mixed bag. The Theory of Everything won the Golden Globe while The Grand Budapest Hotel won the BAFTA. A possible upset by The Imitation Game doesn’t seem too out of the question either. As much as I want Interstellar to pull off a miracle, I’m choosing The Grand Budapest Hotel as the most likely.

## BEST FILM EDITING

Film |
-----|
American Sniper|
Boyhood|
The Grand Budapest Hotel|
The Imitation Game|
Whiplash|

Most Deserving: Boyhood

Most Likely: Boyhood

Why: I wasn’t a big fan of American Sniper or The Grand Budapest Hotel and while The Imitation Game was a great film, the editing didn’t standout as particularly impressive. Boyhood and Whiplash however, were both made in part due to impressive editing of different kinds. Boyhood, my personal favorite, had to condense twelve years of filming and storytelling into under three hours while telling a cohesive story. Sandra Adair really excelled with not only turning all that footage into a cohesive story, but doing so in a way that transitioned from year-to-year much better than any other “conventional” film deals with scene or time transitions. Adair helped make Boyhood one continuous film that you could watch and see a family grow over a period of time rather than a chapter book that’s segmented and choppy, taking you out of the film’s trademark conceit every ten minutes.

Whiplash was impressive for different reasons altogether. Tom Cross gave this film an energy and tension that I never thought would be possible with music. How often do you see a film about musicians playing instruments for a jazz band and think, “Ooh, this will be a lot of fun.” Unless your a jazz aficionado, chances are quite slim. But Cross turned it into an exhilarating thrill ride that made you nervous for Andrew Neiman and the other students under the evil tyrant Terence Fletcher. And it wasn’t just the quick cuts and fast pace that made Whiplash a success, it was the smaller character moments and seeing both Andrew and Terence’s progression over the course of the film as they slowly developed into who we see at the end. A great piece of work, but I’ve got to award this to Sandra Adair for Boyhood.
