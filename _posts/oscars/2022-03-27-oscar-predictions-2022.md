The last couple of years has seen me get progressively worse at keeping up-to-date with film and tracking what I've seen. My [Letterboxd diary][1] is mostly up-to-date, and I try to review films when I can, but it's
a far cry from my previous output. And through all the craziness of the past several years, I didn't even have a prediction post up for the 93rd Oscars.

For this year, I have a lot of N/A entries for my "Most Deserving" pick, because I didn't see a lot of the Best Pictures. I saw some, including venturing out to see *Dune* on the big screen, but I only nabbed five out of ten Best Picture nominees, and many of the Acting and other down-ballot categories I only saw two or less, so decided I couldn't really pick having not seen all that was on-offer.
