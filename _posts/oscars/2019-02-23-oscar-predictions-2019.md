Ninety-first Academy Awards, and the seventh I'm around making predictions for it. With the 86th Academy Awards being the outlier, where I [correctly predicted 22 out of 24 nominees][1], all other years have netted me either 16 or 17 correct predictions out of 24, good for a D+ or a C- on a letter scale &mdash; not good! And with a lot of uncertainly this year from a mixed bag of results in the Guild Awards, the path for the "Most Deserving" nominations is not clear. I am posting this pretty early (the Saturday morning before counts as early, right?), but I did not spend as much time pouring over lists of predictions over the web and cross-referencing with the Guild award winners. That is to say I'm pretty lukewarm on my chances this year. We'll see how I do.

Thanks to my new AMC A-List subscription, I managed to catch all the Best Picture nominees except for *Black Panther* (which I saw last March when it was released), and *BlacKkKlansman* and *Bohemian Rhapsody*. Oh, and *Roma* which I missed in the *very* limited-release in theaters and had to watch on Netflix. The further down the ballot you go though, the less coverage I have on the nominees &mdash; the acting categories specifically. Save for nominees who also have a *Best Picture* nominee, I haven't seen the films, so my "Most Likely" picks are with limited information.

I've come to learn my yearly prediction/public wishing that *this* will be the year I restart this blog in vain aren't completely accurate (almost not at all). So this year, I'm trying for a more realistic wish/hope that I pay more attention and do a better job at watching the acting nominees for next year's Oscars. I got myself to see more of the Best Picture nominees each year, now I want to see more of the down-ballot nominees.

Actual winners listed in **bold**. Final tally: 17/24 correct.

Most Deserving: *Roma*

Most Likely: *Roma*

Why: The only thing everyone can seem to agree on is Best Picture is really up for grabs. *Roma* and *Green Book* seem to have taken on front-runner status because they've won some of the bigger precursor awards, but there is no real consensus. And since opinions are all over the place, it is likely the winner will be decided by the preferential ballot voting which could wind up giving the Oscar to a more obscure choice.

As I mentioned in my recent reviews, *Roma* is far and away my number one choice. Alfonso Cuaron told a simple story in a gripping and technically masterful way. It should be a lock for the Best Foreign Language film, which could make voters want to choose something else here. If *Roma* **does** win, it will be the first foreign language film to do so. While I also have *Roma* winning some other Oscars, my gut feeling is if it *does* win a lot early in the evening, we might be in for a different Best Picture winner. *Green Book* was the second most popular choice from critics, but I might go with *A Star Is Born* or *Black Panther* as more popular/appealing choices for a preferential-voting system.

## BEST ORIGINAL SCORE

Film                         |Composer
-----------------------------|--------
***Black Panther***          | Ludwig Göransson
*BlacKkKlansman*             | Terence Blanchard
*If Beale Street Could Talk* | Nicholas Britell
*Isle of Dogs*               | Alexandre Desplat
*Mary Poppins Returns*       | Marc Shaiman

Most Deserving: *First Man*, Justin Hurwitz

Most Likely: *If Beale Street Could Talk*

Why: I get it. The Academy does not seem to like my picks of loud, in-your-face, electronic at parts, and especially if it is for a space movie. They passed over Hans Zimmer's *Interstellar* and *Dunkirk* and Jóhann Jóhannsson's *Sicario*, three of my last four Best Original Score picks. Not that I'm bitter. And even if Justin Hurwitz's *First Man* was nominated this year, it probably wouldn't have won for similar reasons. And I am bitter about it not even receiving a nomination because it was some of the best music work I have hear all year. That soundtrack is on frequent rotation when I'm at work and still brings the goosebumps when I hear the Apollo rocket launch sequence.

All I can say is I at least was happy to see this make a few of the "Oscar snubs" lists; that at least means other people felt the same way I do. Of the remaining ones, I only saw *Black Panther*, so I can't really speak for the nominees. The consensus seemed to be between *BlacKkKlansman* and *Beale Street* with a slight edge for the latter.

## BEST FILM EDITING

Film |
-----|
*BlacKkKlansman*|
***Bohemian Rhapsody***|
*The Favourite*|
*Green Book*|
*Vice*|

Most Deserving: *The Favourite*

Most Likely: *Bohemian Rhapsody*

Why: *The Favourite* wasn't my favorite film of the year, but I really appreciated a lot of the things it did. Visually and technically *The Favourite* was quite stunning (as was *Roma*), and the editing was a big reason I enjoyed the film as much as I did. The story gets weird towards the end and the characters change a lot from the beginning, but the editing was a nice steady hand. It guided me along through the changes and kept the pace at an appropriate level to process everything that was going on. For me, that is a difficult edit to do. Not the action-based, "experimental" editing à la *The Bourne Ultimatum* win in 2007, but a story-based edit that is a lot more subtle.

On the web, the consensus seemed to be between *Bohemian Rhapsody* and *BlacKkKlansman*, again, both of which I have not seen. Tides were shifting in favor of *BlacKkKlansman*, but *Bohemian Rhapsody* won the Eddie Award and has the good story behind it &mdash; that editor John Ottman saved the film in the editing room from a terrible directing job by Bryan Singer &mdash; so that is what I'm going with as my "Most Likely" pick.
