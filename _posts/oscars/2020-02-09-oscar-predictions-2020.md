Okay, I'm keeping this one short. By now you know the drill here; this is the eighth year I've been making Academy Award predictions. There hasn't been a single review on this site since last year's predictions, but that doesn't mean I completely missed out on this year's films. In fact, this was the first year I saw all the Best Picture nominees *before* the nominees were announced. Not the most exciting tidbit, but I was excited about that.

Anywho, I am not bothering with the header images this year or linking to each individual film &mdash; you can just [head over to my Letterboxd diary][1] and see all my ratings from the past year; I have seen a lot of movies!

## BEST PICTURE

Film |
-----|
*Ford v Ferrari*|
*The Irishman*|
*Jojo Rabbit*|
*Joker*|
*Little Women*|
*Marriage Story*|
*1917*|
*Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*|
*Parasite*|

Most Deserving: *Parasite*

Most Likely: *Parasite*

Why: One of my favorite films of the year was *Parasite*. The other noms I gave a full five-stars to include *Once Upon a Time...*, *Marriage Story*, and *Little Women* (if I had to pick a snub, I would probably pick the surprisingly amazing *Uncut Gems*). The consensus seems to be between *Parasite* and *1917* to win the big award. While I found *1917* to be decent, it wasn't my favorite movie of the year and wouldn't even be my choice for top war movie or top "single-take" movie. I'm sure it will win its fair share of awards tonight, and rightly so in many cases &mdash; it is a technical achievement. But *Parasite* is more interesting. While I haven't seen *Okja*, or any other of Joon-ho's films, I was blown away with *Snowpiercer* and likewise for *Parasite*. It was gripping, thrilling, and an edge-of-my-seat experience for the whole two-hours.

The safe bet seems to be with *1917*, as it has won a lot of the precursor awards and is probably the more Academy-friendly film. But after reading some of the other big predictions, and most people thinking a split between Picture and Director is likely (it has happened in five of the last seven years), I'm switching gears, going bold, and picking *Parasite* for both Deserving and Likely. And in going with the split, you'll see my pick for Sam Mendes below for Best Director, which consensus seems to be the more locked-up award (given he won the Director's Guild prize).

Should be an interesting night, to say the least.

## BEST DIRECTOR

Director          | Film
------------------|-------------
Martin Scorsese   | *The Irishman*
Todd Phillips     | *Joker*
Sam Mendes        | *1917*
Quentin Tarantino | *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*
Bong Joon-ho      | *Parasite*

Most Deserving: Bong Joon-ho

Most Likely: Sam Mendes

## BEST ACTOR

Actor             | Film
------------------|-----------------
Antonio Banderas  | *Pain and Glory*
Leonardo DiCaprio | *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*
Adam Driver       | *Marriage Story*
Joaquin Phoenix   | *Joker*
Jonathan Pryce    | *The Two Popes*

Most Deserving: Adam Driver

Most Likely: Joaquin Phoenix

Why: Like *1917*, I mostly thought that *Joker* was a fine, even good, movie. But I dont' have the same "OMG, wow!" feelings everyone else seems to have about it. Phoenix was indeed probably the best part of the movie, and could be most deserving here. But I'm using my vote to pick Adam Driver from *Marriage Story* to voice my feelings against *Joker*. I really enjoyed Driver's performances in both *Marriage Story* and *Star Wars* this year; both made me take another look at the actor and I have a newfound respect for him after casting him aside for the whiny-braty Kylo Ren from *The Force Awakens*. Adam Driver is so much more than that.
