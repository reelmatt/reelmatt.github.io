Year 1, Day 6

BEFORE: I close out my first run of Al Pacino movies with the 1997 crime drama Donnie Brasco.

AFTER: The first thing that struck me about this film was the performance given by Johnny Depp. Having only seen Depp play Captain Jack Sparrow or an odd character in a Tim Burton movie, I was pleasantly surprised when I found out how well he can pull off an Italian mobster.

The story itself was also surprising for me, in a good way. While the ending was nothing original, as far as other undercover agent crime films go, Donnie Brasco had some twists and turns that made the path to the ending unique. As someone who’s seen a fair amount of crime films, it was nice to find out there are still many things about the mob for me to learn. Case in point, the many meanings of the classic phrase, “Forget about it,” (very minor spoiler at the very end of the clip).

RATING: 4 out of 5
