Year 1, Day 84: Movie #85
BEFORE: Fatal Attraction is the attraction (ah, see what I did there) of the day. Michael Douglas, who had a very minor role in last night’s train wreck returns in the lead role for tonight’s film.
THE PLOT: A married man’s one night stand comes back to haunt him when that lover begins to stalk him and his family.
AFTER: Fatal Attraction didn’t start off on the best foot. Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) and his family are relaxing in an attempt to show the audience who these characters are and have them connect with the characters. But that’s not what happens. The characters seem distant and shallow; like there’s nothing more to them than what meets the eye. So when Dan hooks up with Alex Forrest (Glenn Close), there’s no major ethical objection that’s normally associated with when a husband cheats on his wife.
However, the film gets much better from there. You get to see more of who these characters actually are, the feelings the Gallagher’s have for each other, and how crazy Alex is. This stronger connection with the characters makes the events later on in the film provoke strong reactions. It’s a very gripping ending and I found myself on the edge of my seat, engrossed with that horror that unfolds.
Fatal Attraction is one of those films that grows on you. The performances by Michael Douglas, Anne Archer, and especially Glenn Close are enough reasons to watch the film, but the story also gets strong at the end and leaves you feeling entertained.
RATING: 4 out of 5
