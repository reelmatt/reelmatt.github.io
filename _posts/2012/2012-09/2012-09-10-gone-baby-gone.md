Year 1, Day 72

BEFORE: Tonight I will complete the list of Ben Affleck directed movies with his debut Gone Baby Gone. All I can say is that I’m pretty pumped after the wonderful Argo last night.

AFTER: I don’t know what it is, but Ben Affleck is a great storyteller. Gone Baby Gone is not his best work, but it is still a great film.

Where I felt the film fell apart was the structure. The first half of the film focuses exclusively on the missing child, Amanda. It follows Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) as he investigates the case until it comes to a close. This is only one hour into the film and yet it feels as if the story is complete. The timing is off at the beginning which results in a sub-par opening.

Things do pick up for the ending though. Kenzie becomes involved in a second case that ties in with the first. Clues start getting discovered and questions get answered one after another. Tension and suspense build up, I’d say this is what Affleck is best at, and there is a major twist at the end that left me shocked.

Gone Baby Gone is not Affleck’s best. The Town and Argo are both superior to his debut. But there is still a lot to love in Gone Baby Gone and it’s a great start to a great directing portfolio for Ben Affleck.

RATING: 4 out of 5
