Year 1, Day 33: Movie #34
BEFORE: The Western chain continues with film two in “The Man With No Name Trilogy”, For a Few Dollars More.
THE PLOT: Two bounty hunters with completely different intentions team up to track down a Western outlaw.
AFTER: While this film is considered part of a trilogy of spaghetti westerns by Sergio Leone, it’s not a typical sequel per se. Clint Eastwood’s character is very similar, if not the same person, as the one he played in A Fistful of Dollars, but the stories are not related at all.
For a Few Dollars More is a typical good vs. bad story. The premise is the bad guys, led by El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté), rob a bank and the good guys, Col. Mortimer (Lee Van Clef) and the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) attempt to stop them to collect the reward. The film felt more structured than A Fistful of Dollars which made it easier to follow and understand what was going on. I’m continually impressed by Leone’s use of the camera and editing to create suspense. Many actions were repeated over and over again (e.g. Eastwood killing three enemies, stand-off between multiple people, etc.) but they remained suspenseful each time.
While For a Few Dollars More was more entertaining than its predecessor, there still wasn’t anything that stood out to make this a great film or even a great Western. It’s just a slightly above average film.
RATING: 3 out of 5
