# About me
I graduated from Emerson College in 2015 with a degree in video post production and have
worked since then creating online video content for clinical translational scientists at
Harvard Catalyst. Many of my early short films [can be found on my Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/reelmatt)
and some of the educational courses I have worked on can be found through [the Harvard Catalyst
'Train' page](https://catalyst.harvard.edu/online_learning_matrix.html) including a [promo video
for Comparative Effectiveness Research](https://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/cer/).
